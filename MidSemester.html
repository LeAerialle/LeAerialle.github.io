          <div class="large-8 columns"><p><b>1. Is it important to be involved in student organizations or groups while you are at college?  Why or why not?</b> I think it is important to be involved in groups or organization while in college. It's fun and you get more opportunites to meet new people from different backgrounds.<br/>
              <b>2. As you have been away from home for a few months now, what has been the biggest struggle as you strive for independence?  If you are a commuter student, what has been the biggest struggle as you try and exert your independence while still living at home?</b> This one is kind of hard. I guess setting my own time schedule. Times to study, do homework, and <b>Sleep</b>. At home I was made to go to sleep at a good time, now I have to make sure I get enough sleep on my own. Coming here has really made me hone my time management skills.

              <p><b>3. Since beginning college, what has been your number one “pitfall” that you have faced at Coastal?  How has this impacted your academics?</b> My number one pitfual would be BIOL 122. I took BIOL 121 at a different college, and Coastal did not pick up where that college left off, so I had to catch up. The lecture part of the class brought my GPA down.<br/>
                  <b>4. Looking back on the semester so far, describe a stressful moment you have faced and how you overcame (or haven’t yet overcame) the stress.</b> Taking MATH 161 and MATH 174 together has been quite stressful. There is so much to remember and know for both classes and it can be really hard to follow and understand. I've been going to math outreach and my calc teacher's office hours, so that has been helping.<br/>
                  <b>5. What are some of your expectations of your Academic Advisor?  What role do they play in your academics?</b> I expect my advisor to advise me in choosing my classes and internships. My first advisor was pretty cool. I enjoyed picking my classes out with her. I liked that she knew not to let me take a bunch of core classes because that was my plan and now I know that that would be a bad idea.
