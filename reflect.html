          <div class="large-8 columns"><p><b>What are/were you expecting when you arrived at Coastal?  What were you excited about?  What were you nervous about?</b><br/>I expected people here to be friendly and for there to be nice weather. I was excited about learning new things here. I was nervous about being away from home. Besides sleeping over at a friends house, I have only been away from home one time for a weekend long summer camp, so this was pretty new for me.<br/>
              <b> What has been the hardest thing to get used to since you have arrives on campus?</b><br/>The hardest thing I had to get used to was being away from home. Like I said, this is new for me and it some time getting used to. Like a month into my first semester I went grocery shopping and I kept calling my mom asking her things like what kind of milk do we get.<br>
              <b>Socially, has it been difficult to make friends after arriving on campus?  Why or why not?</b><br>It has been a little. The hardest thing was going up to new people and starting a conversation. I would get caught up in my head worrying about how they would respond like would they be friendly or just ignore me. I'm over that now. Everybody that I have met here have been friendly.<br>
              <b>Academically, what would you say is the biggest difference between high school classes and college classes?</b><br/>The biggest difference between college and high school classes is how much I have to study. It was easier in high school.<br/>
              <b>What has been the best moment since you have arrived on campus?</b><br/>The moment on campus was move-in day. I had been thinking about that day a lot during my last year of high school, so when it finally happened I remember thinking "I'm here" and I was excited about my future here.</p></div>
