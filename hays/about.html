          Dr. Hays' Hospital, originally owned, grown, and led by Dr. Leslie Saint Claire
          "SC" Hays, was built in 1916 on East Carolina Avenue in Clinton, South Caroli-
          na. Ahead of its time in the South, the hospital opened in 1917 as a full communi-
          ty institution serving all races and economic needs through its two medical
          wards, reflective of the segregational tendencies of that era.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because of Dr. Hays and other staff member's decisions to help the war effort
          during World War I, the hospital temporarily closed in 1918. It re-opened in
          1919. From the building's unfortunate destruction by fire in 1926, until June of 1927, Dr. Hays did his hospital work in Laurens,
          South Carolina, a few miles from Clinton. Earlier in 1927, he purchased the 22 year old J.W. Copeland, Jr. home at the corner of Hampton and Woodrow streets.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was here that Dr. Hays established the hospital site known in the mid-
          twentieth century as Hays' Hospital. Dr. Hays left the original home intact but
          added a necessary operating room, eight private rooms, a lab, and two segregat-
          ed wards: one for whites and one for people of color.
        </p>

        <p>
          In June of 2020, the historic brick veneer hospital was purchased by Upstate en-
          trepreneur and philanthropist Leonard Pitts, who grew up in Clinton. Mr. Pitts
          saw a major renovation to this historic site as one way to give back to the com-
          munity of his roots. Legacy at Hays features nine new premier apartments and
          suites, all insightfully designed, built, and wired for modern living.
        </p>

        <p>
          The work of Dr. S.C. Hays in Clinton and other parts of Laurens County will al-
          ways be legendary, and the recent renovations to Hays Hospital directly reflect
          the nurturing doctor's incredible care and attention to the needs of his patients
          and their families.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the hospital's heyday, few small towns in the State of South Carolina could
          boast of better health care facilities than those in Clinton. Now here in the 21st
          Century, Clinton can boast of that excellence in a new and exciting way with the
          attention to detail found throughout Legacy at Hays.
