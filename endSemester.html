          <div class="large-8 columns"><p><b>1. Describe one situation your first semester when you met someone different from yourself or those that you grew up with in your hometown.</b>This happened around my second or third week here. I met this person at a class that I am in. We talked and what made her different was that she moved around a lot. Most people, including myself, from my hometown were born and raised there.<br/>
          <b>2. What is one thing that you learned from this person that you might not have known had you not met them?  Why was that important?</b>
              This may seem insignificant, but I found it interesting. I learned that in Virginia, if you are in the back or passenger seat, then you are not legally required to wear a seatbelt. I thought everyone was universally required to wear a seatbelt no matter wear you sit.
              <br>
              <b>3. After viewing your midterm grades, what changes did you make your habits in the last half of the semester to improve them?</b> I started going to math outreach consistently. I try to go at least once a week. I also joined a group for the students in this class that I am in. I made a daily schedule for myself with my study and free time on it.<br/>
                  <b>4. If you had to do over again, what one thing would you have changed in your first semester at Coastal?  Why would you like a “do-over” for this specific situation?</b> I would change how I interacted with my roommates. Some things when I first got here did not bother me that much, but as the semester went that changed. I wish I had of addressed the thing when it first happened. <br/>
                  <b>5. Did the reality of your first semester match your expectations at the beginning of the semester?  Why or why not?</b> No. I took college classes while in high school, so when I came here I thought it would be more or less the same. I learned very quickly that there is a very big difference between taking two college classes and being a full time college student in a new place.
