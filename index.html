            <h4>I'm from Belton, SC. It's a town in the Upstate about thirty minutes from Greenville, SC. Only a little over four thousand people live there, so it's a pretty small town. Unless you live the deep country part of town, most of the stores are only a short drive away. The most historical thing about Belton is the Standpipe Festival.</h4>

My favorite movies are comic book movies, but I'll watch almost anything besides horror movies. Although I prefer going to the movies, I also like to watch them at home with friends and family I got into origami and guitar playing when I was younger.</h4>
