1.	Because they are the people I’m the most comfortable around.
2.	I post a lot of pictures with my family and friends
3.	We joke around a lot with each other and always have a fun time.
4.	We don’t talk much.
5.	Because I have less to talk about with them, so I don’t talk that much when I’m around them which makes them think that I’m very, very quiet.
6.	I’m a student.

This reveals that I play different parts when I’m around different people. Not that I’m being fake around my friends here, I’m still being me. I am quiet… sometimes, I’m just not that quiet. It’s like I said, I have more to talk about with people I know well, so I say more around them.  This shows that I’m not as comfortable around people at Coastal, as I am with people from home.
